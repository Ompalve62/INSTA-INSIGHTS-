PLEASE READ THESE CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.

The general contracting conditions hereby apply for any use of Influencity products, developed by INFLUENCITY, S.L., by the CLIENT or “the Customer”, whose identity data will be documented in the particular contract conditions, order form, sign up form, or in the consent form.

Influencity, S.L., hereafter INFLUENCITY or Influencity, is an entity of Spanish nationality whose registered office is in Valencia, Ribera 1, Entlo. 1 y 2, tax ID number ESB98684574, and whose main activity consists of developing and operating services related with influencers marketing.

This is a contract between you (the Customer) and us (Influencity). It describes the services we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the languages are necessarily “legalese”, but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. These terms are so important that we cannot provide our products and services to you unless you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are agreeing to these terms.

We periodically update these terms. If you have an active Influencity subscription, we will let you know when we do via an email or in-app notification.

Finally, we know legal terms can sometimes be difficult to navigate, so we wanted to give you a roadmap of the Agreement:

 

A. DEFINITIONS. This is where we provide the detail on what the key defined terms in the Agreement mean. You can think of this kind of like a contractual dictionary.

B. GENERAL COMMERCIAL TERMS. Here’s where you can find the basics about how our Subscription Service and Consulting Services are provided. For example, you can find information on access and acceptable use. These terms apply to all of our products and service offerings.

C. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS. Customers of ours subscribe to use our software (yep, it’s SaaS), and there are some fundamental terms that apply to each subscription. There are some differences between the different types of subscriptions, and here’s where you can find that detail.

D. PRODUCT DISCLOSURES.  We offer several different products and there are some important things to know before you use them. We’ve collected these important things to know and you can find them here.

E. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS. As we mention above, this is a contract, and contracts are filled with legal terms. In this section, we’ve collected the many of the remaining legal terms that make up our Customer Terms of Service.

F. JURISDICTION SPECIFIC TERMS. With customers across the globe, this final section is where we address most of the differences in these terms that vary based on customer location.

If you are using any Influencity Service, this AUP applies to you. Every client of ours agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible for any violations.

2. Prohibited Email Actions 
a. You may not use Influencity to send spam. Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one commercial emails.

Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content.

One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish a lawful basis of processing.

b. You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email addresses, or subject lines. 

Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the Influencity Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid or forged headers; (b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path; (d) use other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party's internet domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment without the third party’s permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (g) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.

If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best Communications Practices document is available here. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to follow these practices.

You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the Influencity Service will contain: (a) header information that is not false or misleading; and (b) an advisement that the recipient may unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information). These requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not otherwise required by law. You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe, "do not call" and "do not send" requests.

Below, we explain how we process your personal information and provide you, in detail, with all relevant information regarding your privacy:

 

What are the data collection methods? We gather publicly available information obtained directly or indirectly via various data sources such as social media networks and other sources; and/or Registration form and use of the Platform.

What data do we collect? The publicly available information may include Identifying and contact information. We collect your identifying information (name, username), publicly available information regarding your social network profile and any other information made manifestly public.

When registering through our Platform, we may collect the same information as well as email address and password, and other identifying information you may include in your account voluntarily (gender, telephone number, date of birth, link to your social media accounts, rates for posting and creating content, profile description and images).

You may also be required to give us permission to collect personal information from your social media accounts via API.

Profiling: We collect and produce profiles about you as an influencer to create a classification based on: your reach (number of followers, audience, etc.); the context of your followers (country, demographic information, industry, activities or products you create content about, potential target audience) and other significant variables in relation to the social networks you are present on.

What are the purposes of the processing of your personal data? When registering in our Platform, we’ll process your data to manage your account and give you access to different functionalities available.

The main purpose for processing your personal data, through your account, is to allow our customers to find Influencers who may fit their values, public target and other requirements and help them connect with Influencers to create and manage marketing campaigns.

You may also be able to manage permissions for our various customers through your account, so that they can (i) view your personal information added to your account; (ii) contact you; and (iii) offer you to participate in their campaigns.

Take into account that our customers may use your personal information and data according to their own privacy policy.

What is the legitimacy basis that allows us to process your data? Is it mandatory to provide these data? We collect and process your personal information based on our legitimate interests to enable our customers and you as an influencer to connect and create marketing campaigns. There is a mutual benefit to both companies and influencers when providing a channel for you to meet and communicate with each other through our platform. For more information regarding the balancing of legitimate interests in this case, please, contact us at legal@influencity.com.

If you request to register and be included on our Platform, we collect and process your Personal Data and access to the information included in your social media account with your consent or for the performance of a contract (i.e. the terms of use applicable to influencers available at https://influencity.com/legal/legal-stuff ).

How long do we keep your information? All your personal information will be processed during the time it is necessary to fulfill the purposes indicated above. We may retain your personal information for longer if it may be the subject of a legal claim, or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.

 

Website Navigation (cookies)

We use cookies or other tracking and tracing tools on this Website to collect information about how users use the Website.

For more information about how we use these tracking tools, please visit our Cookie Policy.

 

4. TO WHOM DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
In general, INFLUENCITY will not communicate your data to third parties. However, in addition to the transfers that we specifically indicate in the section in which we explain the characteristics of the different operations (point 3), we inform you of the communications that we can make, in general, and that affect all previous treatments and their legitimate grounds.

i. Customers, certain personal information will be available to our customers so they can evaluate your suitability to participate in their campaigns. This information may include your name, public information of your social media account(s), and related estimated statistics.

ii. Service Providers, (for example, hosting companies or platforms for sending commercial communications). Notwithstanding the foregoing, these entities have signed the corresponding confidentiality agreements and will only process your data according to our instructions, and not being able to use them for their own purposes or apart from the service they provide us.

The current list of processors is included in the following link: https://influencity.com/legal/sub-processors-list

iii. Public Bodies. We may disclose to the competent public authorities the data and any other information in our possession or accessible through our systems when there is a legal obligation to do so, as well as when required, for example, when the purpose is to prevent or prosecute abuse of services or fraudulent activities through our Website or web page. In such cases, the personal data you provide to us would be kept and made available to administrative or judicial authorities.

iv. In the event of a corporate transaction: In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of all or part of its assets, or any other type of corporate transaction involving a third party, we may share, disclose or transfer user data to the successor entity (including during the pre-transaction phase).

v. To third parties after aggregation or anonymization: We may disclose or use aggregated or anonymized data (i.e., data that cannot be linked to an identified or identifiable natural person) for any purpose.

vi. To third parties with your consent or other legitimate basis: In the event that we want to share data with third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy, we will always seek your consent or inform you of your consent and legitimate basis.

We also inform you that this Privacy Policy only refers to the collection, processing and use of information (relating to personal data) by us through your interaction with our Website. Access to third party websites that you may access through links from the Website have their own privacy policies over which we have no control. Therefore, before you provide them with any personal information, we recommend that you read their privacy policies.

 

5. ARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA TRANSFERRED TO THIRD COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE ECONOMIC AREA?
Some of our service providers are located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

The location of these companies outside the EEA implies the existence of an international transfer of your personal data, which could lead to a lower level of protection than that provided for in European legislation. However, INFLUENCITY has implemented measures to ensure that such transfers do not result in a lower level of protection of your personal data.

In this regard, service providers outside the EEA have signed the corresponding standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission ("STC"), an agreement signed between the two entities by which the non-EU company guarantees that it applies European data protection standards.

Therefore, the use of these providers does not result in a lesser degree of protection of your personal data than the use of providers located in the European Union. You can consult the content of the TCHs in the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-controllers-and-processors_en

 

6. WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS YOU CAN EXERCISE AS A DATA SUBJECT AND HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE THEM?
You can exercise the rights that the law guarantees you in relation to the processing of your personal data by contacting us via email at legal@influencity.com.

Any claim we receive will be resolved as soon as possible and, in any event, within the maximum time limit established by law from the time we receive it.
